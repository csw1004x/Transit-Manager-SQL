# Transit Managing App
# project_f3i3b_s0a7r_t1h7j

The main user of this database application will be managers of the transit system. After inputting
their manager ID and password these users will be able to use the database to schedule buses,
schedule employees to drive particular routes, create and remove bus stops, create and remove
routes, and manage passenger accounts. Our application will benefit city transit systems as a
means of providing data that will help optimize infrastructure and transportation planning within
urban centres. Our project will also help provide meaningful insights such as which stops are the
most popular based on ticket zone sales, whether more buses are required, or if additional stops
are needed on a route.

This project will be created using Oracle and PHP . We do not currently plan on using any
special software or hardware.
